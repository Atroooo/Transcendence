Final project for the Commun Core at the 42 School.
Made with @neoff69 and @JulesLaisne

This project aims to create a dockerized website that allows users to set up an account, see statistics, play games of Pong and also play tournaments. The tournament are saved on the ETH blockchain.
The project was coded mainly in Python using Django and Javascript. 
I also trained an AI to play Pong against the player using Python (pygame and NEAT library).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Atroooo/Transcendence.git
cd Transcendence
```

You have to fill the env file with all the informations needed.
As an host you can put 127.0.0.1.

```bash
make 
```

When the docker is running, you can go at : https://localhost:8000/
You can create an account, activate it with your mail and use the site.
